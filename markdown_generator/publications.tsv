How important are they for a state's productivity? And do the tradeoffs between policies depend on their effectiveness? Using data on 16 million public purchases in Russia, we show that 39 percent of the variation in prices paid for narrowly defined items is due to the individual bureaucrats and organizations who manage procurement. Low-price buyers also display higher spending quality. Theory suggests that such differences in effectiveness can be pivotal for policy design. To illustrate, we show that a common one-bid preferences for domestic suppliers-substantially improves procurement performance, but only when implemented by ineffective bureaucrats."	bhs_state_effectiveness	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/BestHjortSzakonyi-StateEffectivenessProcurement-withOA.pdf		published

In collaboration with the government of Punjab, Pakistan, we shift authority from monitors to procurement officers and introduce financial incentives in a sample of 600 procurement officers in 26 districts. We find that autonomy alone reduces prices by 9% without reducing quality and that the effect is stronger when the monitor tends to delay approvals for purchases until the end of the fiscal year. In contrast, the effect of performance pay is muted, except when agents face a monitor who does not delay approvals. Time use data reveal agents' responses vary along the same margin: autonomy increases the time devoted to procurement and this leads to lower prices only when monitors cause delays. By contrast, incentives work when monitors do not cause delays. The results illustrate that organizational design and anti-corruption policies must balance agency issues at different levels of the hierarchy."	bbkp_procurement	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/BBKP_AuthorityOrganizations_FinalManuscript_WithAppendix.pdf		published	 
2018-06-24	Housing Market Responses to Transaction Taxes: Evidence from Notches and Stimulus in the UK	<a href=https://www.henrikkleven.com>Henrik Kleven</a>	[Henrik Kleven](https://www.henrikkleven.com)	Review of Economic Studies	"85(1), 157-193"	"We investigate housing market responses to transaction taxes using administrative data on all property transactions in the UK from 2004-2012 combined with quasi-experimental variation from tax notches and tax stimulus. We present two main findings. First, transaction taxes are highly distortionary across a range of margins, causing large distortions to the price, volume and timing of property transactions. Second, temporary transaction tax cuts are an enormously effective form of fiscal stimulus. A temporary elimination of a 1% transaction tax increased housing market activity by 20% in the short run (due to both timing and extensive responses) and less than half of the stimulus effect was reversed after the tax was reintroduced (due to re-timing). Because of the complementarities between moving house and consumer spending, these stimulus effects translate into extra spending per dollar of tax cut equal to about 1. We interpret our empirical findings in the context of a housing model with downpayment constraints in which leverage amplifies the effects of transaction taxes."	bk_stampduty	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/best-kleven_landnotches_sep2016.pdf		published

In the U.K., the mortgage interest rate features discrete jumps-notches-at thresholds for the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. These notches generate large bunching below the critical LTV thresholds and missing mass above them. We develop a dynamic model that links these empirical moments to the underlying structural EIS. The average EIS is small, around 0.1, and quite homogeneous in the population. This finding is robust to structural assumptions and can allow for uncertainty, a wide range of risk preferences, portfolio reallocation, liquidity constraints, present bias, and optimization frictions. Our findings have implications for the numerous calibration studies that rely on larger values of the EIS."	bcik_mortgagenotches	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/BCIK_MortgageNotches_Oct2018.pdf		published

This includes minimum tax schemes whereby firms are taxed on either profits or turnover, depending on which tax liability is larger. Such schemes create nonstandard kink points, which allow for eliciting evasion responses to switches between profit and turnover taxes using a bunching approach. Using administrative data on corporations in Pakistan, we estimate that turnover taxes reduce evasion by up to 60-70 percent of corporate income. Incorporating this in a calibrated optimal tax model, we find that switching from profit to turnover taxation increases revenue by 74 percent without reducing aggregate profits."	bbksw_prodrevefficiency	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/BestEtAl_PakistanEvasion_Sep2014_Final.pdf		published	 
2025-02-07	Salary Misreporting and the Role of Firms in Workers' Responses to Taxes: Evidence from Pakistan					"This paper exploits employee-employer matched administrative tax data on firms and salaried workers in Pakistan to explore the underappreciated role of firms in determining how workers' taxable earnings respond to taxation. I present evidence on three ways in which firms affect workers' earnings responses. First, third-party reporting of salaries by employers makes underreporting taxable income more costly for workers and reduces evasion of the income tax. Second, firms' equilibrium salary-hours offers respond endogenously to the presence of adjustment costs in the labour market by tailoring offers to aggregate worker preferences. Third, workers learn about the tax schedule from firms' salary offers, making them more responsive to taxation both contemporaneously (by 130%) and in subsequent years (by 100%). However, while third-party reporting makes misreporting more costly, it does not eliminate it in a low tax-capacity setting: 19% of workers still underreport their salaries, leading to a loss of about 5% of tax revenue, and indicating high returns to investments in improving enforcement capacity. The large role played by firms in determining workers' earnings implies that firms need to play a central role in our analysis of income taxation in lower income countries."	salarymisreporting	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/Best_PakistanSalaryMisreporting_Feb2025.pdf		working	Submitted
2013-08-31	Optimal Income Taxation with Career Effects of Work Effort	<a href=https://www.henrikkleven.com>Henrik Kleven</a>	[Henrik Kleven](https://www.henrikkleven.com)			"The literature on optimal income taxation assumes that wage rates are generated exogenously by innate ability and therefore do not respond to behavior and taxation. This is in stark contrast to a large empirical literature documenting a strong effect of current work effort on future wage rates. We extend the canonical Mirrleesian optimal tax framework to incorporate such career effects and provide analytical characterizations that depend on estimable entities. Besides the standard static earnings elasticity with respect to the marginal tax rate, the optimal tax schedule also depends on the elasticity of future wages with respect to current work effort. We explore the empirical magnitude of this ""career elasticity"" in a meta-analysis of the literature on the returns to work experience and tenure, concluding that a reasonable value for this elasticity lies between 0.2 and 0.4. Calibrating the model to US micro data (under reasonable values of the career elasticity), we present numerical simulations of optimal nonlinear tax schedules that depend on per-period earnings and potentially on age. In the case of age-independent taxation, the presence of career effects make the tax schedule substantially less progressive than in standard models with exogenous wage rates. In the case of age-dependent taxation, career effects create a strong argument for lower taxes on the old, opposite the recommendation in the recent literature on age-dependent taxation. This result reflects both a career incentive effect and an equity effect, where the latter effect arises because increasing earnings over the career path for each ability level imply that, conditional on earnings, age and ability are negatively correlated."	taxcareerconcerns	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/best-kleven_careers_feb2013.pdf		working

We study the case of Manaus, Brazil, where sewer connections vary considerably across the city and property taxes are calculated in a presumptive manner that does not account for a household's access to sanitation. We find that households with access to the city sewer system are significantly more likely to pay their property tax, relative to households that only have access to latrines or lack access to improved sanitation entirely. Our evidence is consistent with a role for the social contract in this decision, as households with sewer systems are more likely to have positive attitudes towards the municipal government."	kwbgn_sanitation	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/KreschWalkerBestGerardNaritomi-SanitationPropertyTaxCompliance-Jul2021.pdf		published

World Bank"	"Measuring the performance of government agencies is notoriously hard due to the lack of comparable data. At the same time, governments around the world generate an immense amount of data that detail their day-to-day operations. In this chapter we focus on three functions of government that represent the bulk of their operations and that are fairly standardized: social security programs, public procurement, and tax collection. We discuss how public sector organizations can use existing administrative case data and re-purpose them to construct objective measures of performance. We argue that it is paramount to compare cases that are homogeneous or construct a metric that captures the complexity of the case. We also argue that the metrics of government performance should capture both the volumes of services provided as well as their quality. With these considerations in mind, case data can be at the core of a diagnostic system with the potential to transform the speed and quality of public service delivery."	bfk_analytics	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/GAH-CHAPTER-15.pdf		bkchap

These proxies are often imperfect, leading to misclassification and inequities among equally deserving individuals. This paper studies the efficiency effects of such misclassification in the context of the property tax system in Manaus, Brazil. We leverage quasi-experimental variation in inequity generated by the boundaries of geographic sectors used to compute tax liabilities and a large tax reform in a series of augmented boundary discontinuity designs. We find that inequities significantly reduce compliance. The elasticity of compliance with respect to inequity is between 0.12 and 0.25, accounting for half of the observed change in compliance. A simple model of presumptive property taxation shows how mistagging affects the optimal tax schedule, highlighting the opposite implications of responses to the level of taxation and to inequity for optimal tax progressivity. Interpreting our findings through the lens of the model implies that optimal progressivity is around 50% lower than it would be absent inequity responses. These results highlight the importance of inequity for public policy design, especially in contexts with low fiscal capacity."	bcgknz_inequity	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/BCGKNZ_Inequity_Feb25.pdf		working

This data allows us to observe private sector transactions by government suppliers, as well as by firms that are not government suppliers but do transact goods purchased by the government. Thus, we can benchmark Business-to-Government (B2G) against Business-to-Business (B2B) transactions, identify the pool of potential suppliers, and determine if and when the government accesses suppliers with better prices. We begin by leveraging recent advances in Natural Language Processing to classify products based on the free-text descriptions in invoices. Then, we describe the circumstances under which governments pay more (or less) for goods in the pharmaceutical market. On average, we find that the government pays 13.6% more than the private sector for the same goods. However, when controlling for supplier fixed effects, this difference drops to -8%, indicating that while the government selects higher-priced suppliers, it successfully negotiates lower prices from those contracted. This suggests that obtaining better value-for-money depends largely on the government's access to more competitive sellers. We also find substantial heterogeneity across products and some evidence that a larger government presence in a market is associated with a smaller supplier selection issue and greater price advantages in public versus private purchases from the same supplier."	bcns_govprices	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/BCNS_SP_Procurement_Oct24.pdf		working

We find remarkable heterogeneity in evasion by firm size with the evaded amount exceeding the reported liability in the bottom three quartiles but is merely 7 percent in the top. Despite detecting substantial liabilities, audit does not deter tax evasion. Examining more than ten outcomes, we detect no effect of audit on proximate or distant behavior.
