2023-08-01	Individuals and Organizations as Sources of State Effectiveness	<a href=https://sites.google.com/site/jonashjort/>Jonas Hjort</a> and <a href = https://davidszakonyi.com/>David Szakonyi</a>	American Economic Review	"113(8), 2121-2167"	"Bureaucrats implement policy. How important are they for a state's productivity? And do the tradeoffs between policies depend on their effectiveness? Using data on 16 million public purchases in Russia, we show that 39 percent of the variation in prices paid for narrowly defined items is due to the individual bureaucrats and organizations who manage procurement. Low-price buyers also display higher spending quality. Theory suggests that such differences in effectiveness can be pivotal for policy design. To illustrate, we show that a common one-bid preferences for domestic suppliers-substantially improves procurement performance, but only when implemented by ineffective bureaucrats."	bhs_state_effectiveness	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/BestHjortSzakonyi-StateEffectivenessProcurement-withOA.pdf		published
2021-08-19	The Allocation of Authority in Organizations: A Field Experiment with Bureaucrats	"<a href = https://www.orianabandiera.net/>Oriana Bandiera</a>, <a href = https://adnanqkhan.com/>Adnan Khan</a>, and <a href = https://www.columbia.edu/~ap3116/>Andrea Prat</a>"	Quarterly Journal of Economics	"136(4), 2195--2242"	"We design a field experiment to study how the allocation of authority between frontline procurement officers and their monitors affects performance both directly and through the response to incentives. In collaboration with the government of Punjab, Pakistan, we shift authority from monitors to procurement officers and introduce financial incentives in a sample of 600 procurement officers in 26 districts. We find that autonomy alone reduces prices by 9% without reducing quality and that the effect is stronger when the monitor tends to delay approvals for purchases until the end of the fiscal year. In contrast, the effect of performance pay is muted, except when agents face a monitor who does not delay approvals. Time use data reveal agents' responses vary along the same margin: autonomy increases the time devoted to procurement and this leads to lower prices only when monitors cause delays. By contrast, incentives work when monitors do not cause delays. The results illustrate that organizational design and anti-corruption policies must balance agency issues at different levels of the hierarchy."	bbkp_procurement	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/BBKP_AuthorityOrganizations_FinalManuscript_WithAppendix.pdf		published
2017-06-24	Housing Market Responses to Transaction Taxes: Evidence from Notches and Stimulus in the UK	<a href=https://www.henrikkleven.com>Henrik Kleven</a>	Review of Economic Studies	"85(1), 157-193"	"We investigate housing market responses to transaction taxes using administrative data on all property transactions in the UK from 2004-2012 combined with quasi-experimental variation from tax notches and tax stimulus. We present two main findings. First, transaction taxes are highly distortionary across a range of margins, causing large distortions to the price, volume and timing of property transactions. Second, temporary transaction tax cuts are an enormously effective form of fiscal stimulus. A temporary elimination of a 1% transaction tax increased housing market activity by 20% in the short run (due to both timing and extensive responses) and less than half of the stimulus effect was reversed after the tax was reintroduced (due to re-timing). Because of the complementarities between moving house and consumer spending, these stimulus effects translate into extra spending per dollar of tax cut equal to about 1. We interpret our empirical findings in the context of a housing model with downpayment constraints in which leverage amplifies the effects of transaction taxes."	bk_stampduty	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/best-kleven_landnotches_sep2016.pdf		published
2020-03-01	Estimating the Elasticity of Intertemporal Substitution Using Mortgage Notches	"<a href = https://sites.google.com/site/jamescloyne/>James Cloyne</a>, <a href = https://www.ilzetzki.com/>Ethan Elzetzki</a>, and <a href=https://www.henrikkleven.com>Henrik Kleven</a>"	Review of Economic Studies	"87(2), 656-690"	"Using a novel source of quasi-experimental variation in interest rates, we develop a new approach to estimating the Elasticity of Intertemporal Substitution (EIS). In the U.K., the mortgage interest rate features discrete jumps-notches-at thresholds for the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. These notches generate large bunching below the critical LTV thresholds and missing mass above them. We develop a dynamic model that links these empirical moments to the underlying structural EIS. The average EIS is small, around 0.1, and quite homogeneous in the population. This finding is robust to structural assumptions and can allow for uncertainty, a wide range of risk preferences, portfolio reallocation, liquidity constraints, present bias, and optimization frictions. Our findings have implications for the numerous calibration studies that rely on larger values of the EIS."	bcik_mortgagenotches	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/BCIK_MortgageNotches_Oct2018.pdf		published
2015-12-01	Production versus Revenue Efficiency with Limited Tax Capacity: Theory and Evidence from Pakistan	"<a href = https://www.annebrockmeyer.com/>Anne Brockmeyer</a>, <a href=https://www.henrikkleven.com>Henrik Kleven</a>, <a href = https://personal.lse.ac.uk/spinnewi/>Johannes Spinnewijn</a>, and <a href=https://mazharwaseem.com/>Mazhar Waseem</a>"	Journal of Political Economy	"123(6), 1311-1355"	"To fight evasion, many developing countries use production-inefficient tax policies. This includes minimum tax schemes whereby firms are taxed on either profits or turnover, depending on which tax liability is larger. Such schemes create nonstandard kink points, which allow for eliciting evasion responses to switches between profit and turnover taxes using a bunching approach. Using administrative data on corporations in Pakistan, we estimate that turnover taxes reduce evasion by up to 60-70 percent of corporate income. Incorporating this in a calibrated optimal tax model, we find that switching from profit to turnover taxation increases revenue by 74 percent without reducing aggregate profits."	bbksw_prodrevefficiency	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/BestEtAl_PakistanEvasion_Sep2014_Final.pdf		published
2014-09-30	Salary Misreporting and the Role of Firms in Workers' Responses to Taxes: Evidence from Pakistan				"This paper exploits employee-employer matched administrative tax data on firms and salaried workers in Pakistan to explore the underappreciated role of firms in determining how workers' taxable earnings respond to taxation. I present evidence on three ways in which firms affect workers' earnings responses. First, third-party reporting of salaries by employers makes underreporting taxable income more costly for workers and reduces evasion of the income tax. Second, firms' equilibrium salary-hours offers respond endogenously to the presence of adjustment costs in the labour market by tailoring offers to aggregate worker preferences. Third, workers learn about the tax schedule from firms' salary offers, making them more responsive to taxation both contemporaneously (by 130%) and in subsequent years (by 100%). However, while third-party reporting makes misreporting more costly, it does not eliminate it in a low tax-capacity setting: 19% of workers still underreport their salaries, leading to a loss of about 5% of tax revenue, and indicating high returns to investments in improving enforcement capacity. The large role played by firms in determining workers' earnings implies that firms need to play a central role in our analysis of income taxation in lower income countries."	salarymisreporting	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/Best_PakistanSalaryMisreporting_May2014.pdf		working
2013-08-31	Optimal Income Taxation with Career Effects of Work Effort	<a href=https://www.henrikkleven.com>Henrik Kleven</a>			"The literature on optimal income taxation assumes that wage rates are generated exogenously by innate ability and therefore do not respond to behavior and taxation. This is in stark contrast to a large empirical literature documenting a strong effect of current work effort on future wage rates. We extend the canonical Mirrleesian optimal tax framework to incorporate such career effects and provide analytical characterizations that depend on estimable entities. Besides the standard static earnings elasticity with respect to the marginal tax rate, the optimal tax schedule also depends on the elasticity of future wages with respect to current work effort. We explore the empirical magnitude of this ""career elasticity"" in a meta-analysis of the literature on the returns to work experience and tenure, concluding that a reasonable value for this elasticity lies between 0.2 and 0.4. Calibrating the model to US micro data (under reasonable values of the career elasticity), we present numerical simulations of optimal nonlinear tax schedules that depend on per-period earnings and potentially on age. In the case of age-independent taxation, the presence of career effects make the tax schedule substantially less progressive than in standard models with exogenous wage rates. In the case of age-dependent taxation, career effects create a strong argument for lower taxes on the old, opposite the recommendation in the recent literature on age-dependent taxation. This result reflects both a career incentive effect and an equity effect, where the latter effect arises because increasing earnings over the career path for each ability level imply that, conditional on earnings, age and ability are negatively correlated."	taxcareerconcerns	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/best-kleven_careers_feb2013.pdf		working
2023-01-01	Sanitation and property tax compliance: Analyzing the social contract in Brazil	"<a href = https://sites.google.com/view/epkresch/home>Evan Plous Kresch</a>, <a href = https://www.markdwalker.com/home>Mark Walker</a>, <a href = https://sites.google.com/site/fransgerard/home>Fran&ccedil;ois Gerard</a>, and <a href = https://joananaritomi.com/>Joana Naritomi</a>"	Joural of Development Economics	"160, 102954"	"This paper investigates the role that sanitation plays in upholding the social contract, whereby citizens pay taxes in exchange for governments providing goods and services. We study the case of Manaus, Brazil, where sewer connections vary considerably across the city and property taxes are calculated in a presumptive manner that does not account for a household's access to sanitation. We find that households with access to the city sewer system are significantly more likely to pay their property tax, relative to households that only have access to latrines or lack access to improved sanitation entirely. Our evidence is consistent with a role for the social contract in this decision, as households with sewer systems are more likely to have positive attitudes towards the municipal government."	kwbgn_sanitation	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/KreschWalkerBestGerardNaritomi-SanitationPropertyTaxCompliance-Jul2021.pdf		published
2023-07-31	Government Analytics Using Administrative Case Data	"<a href = https://sites.google.com/site/alessandrafenizia/home>Alessandra Fenizia</a>, and <a href = https://adnanqkhan.com/>Adnan Khan</a>"	Chapter 15 in The Government Analytics Handbook: Leveraging Data to Strengthen Public Administration	"edited by Daniel Rogger and Christian Schuster, Whington D.C. World Bank"	"Measuring the performance of government agencies is notoriously hard due to the lack of comparable data. At the same time, governments around the world generate an immense amount of data that detail their day-to-day operations. In this chapter we focus on three functions of government that represent the bulk of their operations and that are fairly standardized: social security programs, public procurement, and tax collection. We discuss how public sector organizations can use existing administrative case data and re-purpose them to construct objective measures of performance. We argue that it is paramount to compare cases that are homogeneous or construct a metric that captures the complexity of the case. We also argue that the metrics of government performance should capture both the volumes of services provided as well as their quality. With these considerations in mind, case data can be at the core of a diagnostic system with the potential to transform the speed and quality of public service delivery."	bfk_analytics	http://michaelcbest.github.io/files/GAH-CHAPTER-15.pdf		bkchap
2024-10-01	Greener on the Other Side: Inequity and Tax Compliance	"<a href = https://www.luigicaloi.com/>Luigi Caloi</a>, <a href = https://sites.google.com/site/fransgerard/home>Fran&ccedil;ois Gerard</a>, <a href = https://sites.google.com/view/epkresch/home>Evan Plous Kresch</a>,   <a href = https://joananaritomi.com/>Joana Naritomi</a>, and <a href = https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/team/l/laura-de-castro-zoratto>Laura Zoratto</a>"			"Governments commonly use proxies for deservingness --- tags --- as inputs to tax systems. Indeed, presumptive taxes based exclusively on tags are the predominant way that property taxes are implemented. Imperfect tagging can affect the welfare costs of taxation by creating avoidance responses (people changing their tags), but this paper proposes and estimates a novel channel through which imperfect tagging affects the welfare costs of taxation. Imperfect tags generate inequity by over- or under-taxing households, and distaste for this inequity generates behavioral responses that aggravate the efficiency costs of taxation. Drawing on property tax data from Manaus, Brazil, we exploit boundary discontinuities and a reform to its presumptive property tax to assess the impact of the resulting inequities on tax compliance. Our findings indicate a large elasticity of compliance in response to inequity, with values ranging from 0.14 to 0.25, at least as large as the elasticity of compliance with respect to the tax liability. We develop a simple model of presumptive property taxation to demonstrate how mistagging influences the welfare costs of taxation and dampens the optimal level of tax progressivity, highlighting the critical balance between revenue maximization and equity considerations in tax policy design."	bcgknz_inequity			working
