How important are they for a state's productivity? And do the tradeoffs between policies depend on their effectiveness? Using data on 16 million public purchases in Russia, we show that 39 percent of the variation in prices paid for narrowly defined items is due to the individual bureaucrats and organizations who manage procurement. Low-price buyers also display higher spending quality. Theory suggests that such differences in effectiveness can be pivotal for policy design. To illustrate, we show that a common one-bid preferences for domestic suppliers-substantially improves procurement performance, but only when implemented by ineffective bureaucrats.\"\tbhs_state_effectiveness\thttp://michaelcbest.github.io/files/BestHjortSzakonyi-StateEffectivenessProcurement-withOA.pdf\t\tpublished\t\n",

We find that autonomy alone reduces prices by 9% without reducing quality and that the effect is stronger when the monitor tends to delay approvals for purchases until the end of the fiscal year. In contrast, the effect of performance pay is muted, except when agents face a monitor who does not delay approvals. Time use data reveal agents' responses vary along the same margin: autonomy increases the time devoted to procurement and this leads to lower prices only when monitors cause delays.

We present two main findings. First, transaction taxes are highly distortionary across a range of margins, causing large distortions to the price, volume and timing of property transactions. Second, temporary transaction tax cuts are an enormously effective form of fiscal stimulus. A temporary elimination of a 1% transaction tax increased housing market activity by 20% in the short run (due to both timing and extensive responses) and less than half of the stimulus effect was reversed after the tax was reintroduced (due to re-timing). Because of the complementarities between moving house and consumer spending, these stimulus effects translate into extra spending per dollar of tax cut equal to about 1. We interpret our empirical findings in the context of a housing model with downpayment constraints in which leverage amplifies the effects of transaction taxes.\"\tbk_stampduty\thttp://michaelcbest.github.io/files/best-kleven_landnotches_sep2016.pdf\t\tpublished\t\n",

These notches generate large bunching below the critical LTV thresholds and missing mass above them. We develop a dynamic model that links these empirical moments to the underlying structural EIS. The average EIS is small, around 0.1, and quite homogeneous in the population. This finding is robust to structural assumptions and can allow for uncertainty, a wide range of risk preferences, portfolio reallocation, liquidity constraints, present bias, and optimization frictions.

Such schemes create nonstandard kink points, which allow for eliciting evasion responses to switches between profit and turnover taxes using a bunching approach. Using administrative data on corporations in Pakistan, we estimate that turnover taxes reduce evasion by up to 60-70 percent of corporate income. Incorporating this in a calibrated optimal tax model, we find that switching from profit to turnover taxation increases revenue by 74 percent without reducing aggregate profits.\"\tbbksw_prodrevefficiency\thttp://michaelcbest.github.io/files/BestEtAl_PakistanEvasion_Sep2014_Final.pdf\t\tpublished\t\n",
      "2025-02-07\tSalary Misreporting and the Role of Firms in Workers' Responses to Taxes: Evidence from Pakistan\t\t\t\t\t\"This paper exploits employee-employer matched administrative tax data on firms and salaried workers in Pakistan to explore the underappreciated role of firms in determining how workers' taxable earnings respond to taxation. I present evidence on three ways in which firms affect workers' earnings responses. First, third-party reporting of salaries by employers makes underreporting taxable income more costly for workers and reduces evasion of the income tax. Second, firms' equilibrium salary-hours offers respond endogenously to the presence of adjustment costs in the labour market by tailoring offers to aggregate worker preferences. Third, workers learn about the tax schedule from firms' salary offers, making them more responsive to taxation both contemporaneously (by 130%) and in subsequent years (by 100%). However, while third-party reporting makes misreporting more costly, it does not eliminate it in a low tax-capacity setting: 19% of workers still underreport their salaries, leading to a loss of about 5% of tax revenue, and indicating high returns to investments in improving enforcement capacity. The large role played by firms in determining workers' earnings implies that firms need to play a central role in our analysis of income taxation in lower income countries.\"\tsalarymisreporting\thttp://michaelcbest.github.io/files/Best_PakistanSalaryMisreporting_May2014.pdf\t\tworking\t\n",

This is in stark contrast to a large empirical literature documenting a strong effect of current work effort on future wage rates. We extend the canonical Mirrleesian optimal tax framework to incorporate such career effects and provide analytical characterizations that depend on estimable entities. Besides the standard static earnings elasticity with respect to the marginal tax rate, the optimal tax schedule also depends on the elasticity of future wages with respect to current work effort. We explore the empirical magnitude of this \"\"career elasticity\"\" in a meta-analysis of the literature on the returns to work experience and tenure, concluding that a reasonable value for this elasticity lies between 0.2 and 0.4. Calibrating the model to US micro data (under reasonable values of the career elasticity), we present numerical simulations of optimal nonlinear tax schedules that depend on per-period earnings and potentially on age. In the case of age-independent taxation, the presence of career effects make the tax schedule substantially less progressive than in standard models with exogenous wage rates. In the case of age-dependent taxation, career effects create a strong argument for lower taxes on the old, opposite the recommendation in the recent literature on age-dependent taxation. This result reflects both a career incentive effect and an equity effect, where the latter effect arises because increasing earnings over the career path for each ability level imply that, conditional on earnings, age and ability are negatively correlated.\"\ttaxcareerconcerns\thttp://michaelcbest.github.io/files/best-kleven_careers_feb2013.pdf\t\tworking\t\n",

We find that households with access to the city sewer system are significantly more likely to pay their property tax, relative to households that only have access to latrines or lack access to improved sanitation entirely. Our evidence is consistent with a role for the social contract in this decision, as households with sewer systems are more likely to have positive attitudes towards the municipal government.\"\tkwbgn_sanitation\thttp://michaelcbest.github.io/files/KreschWalkerBestGerardNaritomi-SanitationPropertyTaxCompliance-Jul2021.pdf\t\tpublished\t\n",

At the same time, governments around the world generate an immense amount of data that detail their day-to-day operations. In this chapter we focus on three functions of government that represent the bulk of their operations and that are fairly standardized: social security programs, public procurement, and tax collection. We discuss how public sector organizations can use existing administrative case data and re-purpose them to construct objective measures of performance. We argue that it is paramount to compare cases that are homogeneous or construct a metric that captures the complexity of the case. We also argue that the metrics of government performance should capture both the volumes of services provided as well as their quality. With these considerations in mind, case data can be at the core of a diagnostic system with the potential to transform the speed and quality of public service delivery.\"\tbfk_analytics\thttp://michaelcbest.github.io/files/GAH-CHAPTER-15.pdf\t\tbkchap\t\n",

Indeed, presumptive taxes based exclusively on tags are the predominant way that property taxes are implemented. Imperfect tagging can affect the welfare costs of taxation by creating avoidance responses (people changing their tags), but this paper proposes and estimates a novel channel through which imperfect tagging affects the welfare costs of taxation. Imperfect tags generate inequity by over- or under-taxing households, and distaste for this inequity generates behavioral responses that aggravate the efficiency costs of taxation. Drawing on property tax data from Manaus, Brazil, we exploit boundary discontinuities and a reform to its presumptive property tax to assess the impact of the resulting inequities on tax compliance. Our findings indicate a large elasticity of compliance in response to inequity, with values ranging from 0.14 to 0.25, at least as large as the elasticity of compliance with respect to the tax liability. We develop a simple model of presumptive property taxation to demonstrate how mistagging influences the welfare costs of taxation and dampens the optimal level of tax progressivity, highlighting the critical balance between revenue maximization and equity considerations in tax policy design.\"\tbcgknz_inequity\t\t\tworking\t\n",

This data allows us to observe private sector transactions by government suppliers, as well as by firms that are not government suppliers but do transact goods purchased by the government. Thus, we can benchmark Business-to-Government (B2G) against Business-to-Business (B2B) transactions, identify the pool of potential suppliers, and determine if and when the government accesses suppliers with better prices. We begin by leveraging recent advances in Natural Language Processing to classify products based on the free-text descriptions in invoices. Then, we describe the circumstances under which governments pay more (or less) for goods in the pharmaceutical market. On average, we find that the government pays 13.6\\% more than the private sector for the same goods. However, when controlling for supplier fixed effects, this difference drops to -8\\%, indicating that while the government selects higher-priced suppliers, it successfully negotiates lower prices from those contracted. This suggests that obtaining better value-for-money depends largely on the government�s access to more competitive sellers. We also find substantial heterogeneity across products and some evidence that a larger government presence in a market is associated with a smaller supplier selection issue and greater price advantages in public versus private purchases from the same supplier.\"\tbcns_govprices\t\t\tworking\t\n",
