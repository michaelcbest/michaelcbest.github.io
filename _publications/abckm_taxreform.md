<summary markdown=span> *Abstract*</summary> 
This project aims to trace out the contours of politically feasible property tax reforms through a series of two Randomized Control Trials (RCTs). The first experiment (10/2024-2/2025) measures citizens&apos; preferences for the level and progressivity of property taxes and their determinants. A series of information experiments studies the impacts of tax knowledge, public goods, tax evasion, government waste, and elite capture on citizens&apos; preferences. The second experiment (planned for 4/2025) measures political and bureaucratic decision makers&apos; preferences and responsivenes to different subgroups of citizens&apos; demands. Combining the results from the two experiments, the project will provide a roadmap for feasible property tax reform in Punjab, Pakistan.'
